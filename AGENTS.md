# AGENTS.md — AI Agent Context

## Project Overview

Cashe — a privacy-first Python service that ingests transaction data from Gmail (DBS PayLah!, UOB alerts) and Apple Wallet push notifications, stores them in SQLite, and provides interaction via Telegram bot and a web dashboard. Supports multi-user accounts, budgets, savings goals, and trip tracking.

## Architecture

Single Python monolith, one process, eight subsystems:
1. **Gmail Poller** — scheduled polling of Gmail API for transaction emails, HTML body extraction fallback
2. **Webhook Receiver** — FastAPI endpoint receiving Apple Wallet data from iOS Shortcuts (`/webhook/apple-wallet/{username}`), cross-source dedup
3. **Parser Engine** — plugin-based bank/payment parsers (one class per source)
4. **Ingestion Pipeline** — centralised dedup → exchange rate → categorize → store → recurring detect → trip auto-assign
5. **Interaction Layer** — Telegram bot (commands + notifications + guided UX) + Web dashboard (dark fintech theme, Recharts)
6. **Categorization** — keyword matching + learned merchant overrides, with match source tracking
7. **Intelligence** — recurring transaction detection, spending insights, multi-currency exchange rates, analytics
8. **Finance System** — budgets (monthly/weekly), savings goals with contributions, trip expense tracking, subscriptions with upcoming-transaction tracking
9. **LLM Intelligence** — optional Gemini Flash layer for anomaly explanations, natural-language Telegram parsing, and weekly/monthly AI insights; `None` when `gemini_api_key` is absent

All data in SQLite with WAL mode. Multi-user system with per-user expense DBs and a shared admin DB. Supports income and expense tracking.

## Deployment

**Oracle Cloud** — self-hosted on an OCI instance using Docker Compose. Public HTTPS exposure via **Cloudflare Tunnel** (no open inbound ports required).

```
docker-compose.yml:
  app:        python src/main.py (FastAPI + bot + scheduler)
  cloudflared: cloudflare/cloudflared tunnel — forwards public HTTPS to app:8080
```

**Local volumes:**
- `./config.yaml` → `/app/config.yaml:ro` — all sensitive config (gitignored)
- `./credentials.json` → `/app/credentials.json:ro` — Gmail OAuth credentials (gitignored)
- `./data` → `/data` — persistent SQLite databases and logs

**Key env vars:**
- `TUNNEL_TOKEN` — Cloudflare tunnel token (set in shell/`.env` on the OCI instance)
- `PORT` — overrides the port in config.yaml (defaults to 8080)
- `EXPENSE_DB_PATH` — override per-user DB path (rarely used)
- `EXPENSE_CONFIG_PATH` — override config file path (defaults to `config.yaml`)
- `GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_JSON` — base64-encoded credentials.json (alternative to volume mount)
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` — Google Gemini API key; enables LLM Intelligence when set (overrides `gemini_api_key` in config.yaml)

**No Railway.** All previous AGENTS.md references to Railway, Railway volumes, and base64 env vars for credentials are obsolete. The `/data/` volume is a local bind mount.

## Agent Instructions

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Key Design Decisions

- `source_id` UNIQUE constraint prevents duplicate transactions
- Cross-source dedup: a unique candidate with matching merchant, amount, currency, type, and transaction time within 10 minutes links both source events to one record. Date-only/missing times and ambiguous candidates remain separate. Never compare ingestion time.
- `raw_data` column stores original payloads for re-parsing
- Categories auto-assigned via keyword matching, overridable via `/recategorize` (learns merchant overrides)
- `type` column distinguishes `expense` (default) from `income` transactions
- `exchange_rate` column normalizes foreign currency to SGD; all summaries use `amount * exchange_rate`
- Categorizer returns `(category, match_source)` tuple — match_source is `"learned"`, `"keyword:<kw>"`, or `"default"`
- Merchant overrides stored in `merchant_overrides` table, hot-reloadable via `categorizer.reload_overrides()`
- Recurring transactions detected by consistent amounts (±10%) and intervals (monthly 25-35 days, weekly 6-8 days)
- Exchange rates cached for 24 hours with fallback hardcoded rates when API unreachable
- All sensitive config in `config.yaml` (gitignored) — mounted as a read-only volume in Docker
- Categories have a `type` column (`needs`/`wants`/`neutral`) used for financial health scoring
- Active trip auto-assigns new transactions via `storage.auto_assign_to_active_trip(tx_id)` — one active trip at a time
- `IngestionPipeline` is the single path for all transaction ingestion (Gmail and Webhook) — never bypass it

## Multi-User System

The system supports multiple users. Each user has:
- A row in `app.db` (`users` table) managed by `AdminStorage`
- An isolated SQLite database at `/data/users/<username>/expense_tracker.db`
- A per-user Gmail OAuth token at `/data/users/<username>/token.json`
- A `GmailPoller` and `Categorizer` instance managed by `UserManager`

**`AdminStorage`** (in `src/storage.py`) operates on `app.db` (at `/data/app.db`). Manages users, web sessions (30-day sliding window), admin sessions, and Telegram link tokens.

**`UserManager`** (in `src/user_manager.py`) is the central registry. It constructs and holds `UserContext` objects (Storage + Categorizer + GmailPoller per user). `main.py` and `web/app.py` never instantiate `Storage` or `GmailPoller` directly.

**`UserContext`** fields: `username`, `storage`, `categorizer`, `poller`, `db_path`, `token_path`, `exchange_service`.

**Admin panel** at `/admin` — separate `FastAPI` app mounted on the main app. Uses a separate admin session (not a user session). IP-based login lockout after 5 failures.

**Seeding:** On first boot, if `app.db` has no users, the admin user is created from `config.yaml` (`web.admin_username` / `web.password_hash`). Existing Telegram `chat_id` from a legacy single-user DB is migrated automatically.

**Webhook routing:** Apple Wallet webhooks are per-user: `POST /webhook/apple-wallet/{username}`. The username in the URL is used to resolve the `UserContext`.

**Telegram routing:** `TelegramBotService` holds a reference to `UserManager`. Incoming messages are resolved to a `UserContext` via `user_manager.get_by_chat_id(chat_id)`.

## Backend Conventions

### Storage Layer

- Every expense-only query uses `(type IS NULL OR type = 'expense')` — never just `type = 'expense'`. Pre-migration rows have a NULL type and are silently dropped otherwise.
- All mutating methods (`update_transaction`, `delete_transaction`, `update_category`, `delete_category`) pre-check existence and raise `ValueError("<entity> not found")` on miss. The API layer catches `ValueError` and returns HTTP 404. Never raise `HTTPException` from Storage.
- `delete_category` cascades: reassigns all affected transactions to `'Other'` and deletes matching `merchant_overrides`. Returns the reassigned count, surfaced as `{"status": "ok", "reassigned": count}` in the API.
- `app_settings` stores all values as `TEXT`. Always cast to `float`/`int` at the call site. `set_setting` always receives `str(val)`.
- `ingestion_state` is dual-purpose: Gmail poller state (keyed by source name, e.g. `"dbs_paylah"`) and the Telegram chat ID (stored under `source='telegram_chat_id'`, value in `last_processed_id`). Note: Telegram chat IDs have moved to `app.db users.telegram_chat_id` for new users — the `ingestion_state` approach is legacy.
- `get_categories` orders by `ROWID` (insertion order) — this controls the Telegram inline keyboard order and dashboard dropdown order.
- Default settings use `INSERT OR IGNORE` (preserved after first write). Categories use `INSERT OR REPLACE` on every startup — user-modified keywords in the DB are reset on restart.
- `get_trend_by_category` explicitly sets missing-category keys to `None` (not `0` or absent) for Recharts `connectNulls`. Do not substitute `0` or omit the key.
- The allowed-field whitelist for `update_transaction` is enforced in `web/app.py`, not in `Storage`. Add new editable columns to the `allowed` set in `app.py`.
- `query_transactions` default limit is 100; the API layer defaults to 50; CSV export hard-codes 50,000. Always pass explicit limits in new callers.
- `Storage` uses a `threading.RLock` (via `@_locked` decorator) to serialize all DB calls — safe for concurrent access from web and bot threads.
- `Storage` has no `logging` import — it is a pure data layer. All logging lives in the service layer.

### API Layer

- `require_auth` is `Depends(require_auth)` added to each route individually — there is no global auth middleware. Forgetting it on a new route silently makes it public.
- All responses are raw `dict`/`list` — no Pydantic response models. All DB columns including `raw_data` and `ingested_at` are returned to the client.
- `PUT /api/transactions/{id}` auto-calls `storage.set_merchant_override()` when the category changes, but does not call `categorizer.reload_overrides()` — the web API holds no categorizer reference.
- `PUT /api/settings` is all-or-nothing: validates all fields, collects errors into a dict, raises HTTP 422 with the errors dict, or writes all values atomically. Never writes a partial update.
- Manual transactions via the web API use `source_id = f"manual_{uuid4().hex[:12]}"`. Telegram `/add` uses `f"manual-{timestamp}-{amount}"`. Both use `source="manual"` and coexist in the DB.
- The SPA catch-all `/{full_path:path}` is only registered at startup if `src/web/dist/` exists. If the frontend is not built, all non-API paths return 404.
- All DB calls in the web layer go through `await _db(fn, *args)` — a single-worker `ThreadPoolExecutor` that serialises DB work off the event loop.
- Finance features (budgets, goals, trips) are gated by `app_settings` flags: `budgets_enabled`, `goals_enabled`, `trips_enabled`. The API does not gate them — gating is UI-only.

### Ingestion Pipeline

All transaction ingestion (Gmail and Webhook) goes through `IngestionPipeline` (`src/ingestion.py`). Never bypass it.

Steps in order:
1. Same-source dedup (`source_id_exists`)
2. Cross-source dedup (`find_cross_source_duplicate` — 10-minute window)
3. Exchange rate lookup (skipped if currency is SGD)
4. Categorization (`categorizer.reload_overrides()` then `categorizer.categorize()`)
5. `storage.insert_transaction()`
6. `storage.auto_assign_to_active_trip(tx_id)` (best-effort, never raises)
7. `RecurringDetector.run()` (best-effort, never raises)
8. Returns the stored transaction dict with `_match_source` key added

The `IngestionPipeline` is instantiated per-user inside `UserManager._build_context()`.

### Capture trust foundation

- `source_events` retains the original observation, parser version, status, attempts, and linked transaction. Raw payloads stay server-side.
- Gmail persists source events before advancing checkpoints. It captures configured senders independent of read status and never changes inbox labels.
- Initial/resync history is bounded to 90 days, paginated with persisted progress. Expired history restarts bounded synchronization. Automatic processing retries stop after five failures; unrecognized events remain recorded.
- Historical Gmail capture does not notify or join the currently active trip.
- `GmailPoller.poll_once()` now returns stored transaction dictionaries. `force_poll()` and the background loop use this same path; concurrent cycles and repeated starts are serialized.
- Wallet always uses `IngestionPipeline`, including contexts without a configured poller pipeline.
- Wallet credential hashes live in per-user settings. First valid Bearer request makes credentials mandatory. Revocation keeps intake closed. Never put credentials in URL query parameters or ordinary status responses.
- OAuth state is opaque, single-use, expires after ten minutes, and is bound to the initiating web session. Telegram `/reauth` links to authenticated Settings.
- Recovery CLI: `python -m scripts.backup --help`; see `docs/operations/backups.md`. Never copy live SQLite files for backup.

### Parser System

- Email parsers return `None` on non-match. `AppleWalletParser.parse()` raises `ValueError` on missing required fields (caught by the webhook route and converted to HTTP 400). The Gmail poller does not expect parser exceptions.
- `source_id` construction strategy per parser:

| Parser | Strategy |
|--------|----------|
| Email parsers (`dbs_paylah`, `uob_card`, `uob_paynow`, `uob_transfer`, `uob_nets`, `uob_paynow_sent`) | Gmail RFC822 `Message-ID` header (falls back to `msg["id"]`). Assigned in `GmailPoller._parse_message` — overwrites whatever `source_id` the parser returned (e.g. DBS Transaction Ref is discarded). Email parsers therefore set `source_id=""` or `None`. |
| `apple_wallet` | `sha256(merchant:amount::date)[:16]` — double colon is intentional (empty card-field slot for backward compat). Set by the parser, not overwritten. |
| web manual | `manual_{uuid4().hex[:12]}` |
| bot `/add`, `/cash` | `manual-{YYYYMMDDHHMMSS}-{amount}` |

- Apple Wallet hash uses `f"{merchant}:{amount}::{date}"` — the double colon is a deliberate empty card-field slot for backward compatibility with pre-card-name records. Do not add the card field into this hash.
- Currency parsing precedence: ISO code prefix (`PLN 3.78`) → multi-char symbols (`S$`, `A$`, `HK$`, `RM`...) → single-char symbols (`£`, `€`...) → bare number defaults to SGD. Multi-char must be checked before single-char to avoid `S$` matching as `$`.
- DBS PayLah! infers `datetime.now().year` because the email format omits the year. A December email processed in January will have the wrong year — this is a known limitation.
- `UobParser` handles all UOB email formats in a single class (card purchase, accumulated transit, card reversal, PayNow received, one-time transfer, NETS QR payment, PayNow transfer sent). Source values: `uob_card`, `uob_paynow`, `uob_transfer`, `uob_nets`, `uob_paynow_sent`. Card reversals emit `tx_type="income"`. `uob_paynow` is incoming PayNow (income); `uob_paynow_sent` is outbound PayNow transfer (expense).

### Telegram Bot

- The bot silently drops all outbound notifications until a user's Telegram is linked (chat ID stored in `app.db users.telegram_chat_id`).
- `notify_transaction` and `notify_text` use `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(..., self._loop)` to bridge from the Gmail/APScheduler threads into the bot's asyncio event loop. Never use `await` or `asyncio.run()` in these methods.
- Callback data is namespaced by prefix: `cat:` (new tx category pick), `recat:` (recategorize), `ef_` (edit field), `ec_` (edit category), `cmd_` (menu actions), `confirm_delete_` / `cancel_delete`. Handler registration order matters.
- `/add` and `/cash` only extract a category if a date is also present. Format: `<amount> [currency] <merchant> [category] <date>`.
- `/income` stores the description in the `merchant` column (not `description`), hard-codes `category="Income"` and `type="income"`, and skips the categorizer.
- `_cmd_callback` uses a `SimpleNamespace` / `_ReplyProxy` to let inline button presses re-use existing command handlers without modification.
- All bot commands are routed to the correct user's `UserContext` by resolving the Telegram `chat_id` via `user_manager.get_by_chat_id()`.
- Scheduled summaries per user: weekly (Sunday 8AM), monthly (1st 8AM), daily digest (8AM). Registered in `UserManager._register_scheduler_jobs()`.

### Cross-Cutting Rules

- Always use `local_now()` from `src/config.py` for wall-clock dates. Never use `datetime.now()` or `datetime.utcnow()` — the OCI instance runs UTC and this caused `/today` to show the wrong day for SGT users. `local_now()` defaults to `Asia/Singapore`; configurable via `timezone:` in `config.yaml` or `TIMEZONE` env var.
- `transaction_date` is stored as ISO 8601 string `"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS"`. Range queries must use `DATE(transaction_date) >= ?`. Display truncates to `[:10]`.
- `raw_data` for Apple Wallet transactions is `str(dict)` (Python `repr`), not valid JSON. Re-parsing requires `ast.literal_eval`, not `json.loads`.
- DB path resolution: `DATA_DIR = "/data" if os.path.isdir("/data") else "data"`. Per-user DB: `{DATA_DIR}/users/{username}/expense_tracker.db`. Admin DB: `{DATA_DIR}/app.db`. The `EXPENSE_DB_PATH` env var overrides only the legacy single-user path, not per-user paths.
- Legacy baseline migrations remain in `init_db`. New schema changes use ordered, transactional migrations in `src/migrations.py`; do not add new swallowed migration errors.
- `RecurringDetector` runs inside `IngestionPipeline.ingest()` (both Gmail and Webhook paths). It looks back 90 days and is instantiated per-`UserContext` (stateful — reused across ingestion calls for the same user).
- The `source` column has no `CHECK` constraint — invalid values insert silently. Valid values: `dbs_paylah`, `uob_card`, `uob_paynow`, `uob_paynow_sent`, `uob_transfer`, `uob_nets`, `apple_wallet`, `manual`, `cash`.

### Testing Conventions

- The `in_memory_db` fixture calls production `main.init_db(":memory:")`. New additive migrations live in ordered `src/migrations.py` and run in production and tests. Append migrations; never edit released versions.
- There is no shared `Storage` or `Categorizer` fixture — tests instantiate them inline: `Storage(in_memory_db)`.
- `sample_categories` fixture uses comma-separated string keywords (`"restaurant,cafe,food"`). `sample_config` uses Python lists. Both mirror real usage: Storage receives the comma-separated string form; Categorizer receives the list form from YAML.

## Frontend UI Design System

### Tech Stack

React 19 + TypeScript + Vite. Tailwind CSS v4 (`@theme` block in `index.css` — no config file). Recharts for all charts. Radix UI primitives (Dialog, Select, DropdownMenu, Tabs, Separator, Slot). shadcn/ui component patterns with CVA (class-variance-authority). lucide-react for all icons. TanStack Query for server state. Frontend root: `src/web/frontend/src/`.

### Color Tokens

Defined in `src/web/frontend/src/index.css` under `@theme`. These become both CSS custom properties and Tailwind utility classes.

| Token | Hex | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-background` | `#0B0B14` | Page background |
| `--color-card` | `#161624` | Card surfaces, tooltip background |
| `--color-card-elev` | `#1B1B2C` | Elevated surfaces (dialogs, dropdowns, toasts) |
| `--color-card-hover` | `#1C1C22` | Bar chart hover cursor (Radix compat) |
| `--color-border` | `#2A2A3F` | All borders and dividers |
| `--color-foreground` | `#EEEAF5` | Primary text |
| `--color-muted` | `#7A7488` | Secondary text, axis ticks, labels |
| `--color-teal` / `--color-ring` | `#00D4AA` | CTAs, active states, trend lines, focus ring |
| `--color-accent` | `#EEEAF5` | Radix UI compat token only — **not** the brand teal |
| `--color-destructive` | `#FF453A` | Delete actions, error messages, overspend alerts |
| `--color-success` | `#00D4AA` (= teal) | Income amounts, "on track" / saved status |
| `--color-warning` | `#FBBF24` (= honey) | Unusual spending alerts |
| `--color-info` | `#34D399` (= mint) | Informational, "under pace" velocity |

**Semantic color rules — these have caused real bugs, apply carefully:**
- `text-destructive` for delete buttons, error messages, and "spending ahead of pace" — **never `text-accent`**.
- `text-warning` for unusual spending alert icons and borders — **never `text-accent`**.
- **Never use `text-accent`** for any visible text — `--color-accent` is a Radix UI compat token set to `#EEEAF5` (foreground). Use `text-teal` for brand interactive states.
- `text-success` for income amounts and positive spending velocity (renders as teal `#00D4AA`).
- `text-info` for neutral informational status ("under pace") (renders as mint `#34D399`).

**Button variants (CVA, `src/components/ui/button.tsx`):**
- `default` → gradient primary (`btn-gradient` utility class)
- `outline` → bordered, neutral hover — use for secondary/cancel actions
- `ghost` → no border, neutral hover — use for icon buttons and tertiary actions
- `destructive` → red background — use only for irreversible destructive confirmation buttons
- Never use `destructive` variant for label/toggle buttons that merely navigate to a destructive action.

Spectrum + state/feedback/motion/a11y/money rules: see docs/design-language.md §2, §12–§16.

### Category Color System

`getCategoryColor(category)` in `src/lib/utils.ts` — always use this function, never hardcode category colors. Runtime overrides (learned via recategorization) are loaded into `_categoryColorOverrides` via `setCategoryColors()`.

**Hex-suffix opacity convention** for category row tinting — must be consistent across all transaction lists:
- Row background resting: `${categoryColor}0D` (5% opacity)
- Row background hover: `${categoryColor}1A` (10% opacity)
- Icon pill background: `${categoryColor}33` (20% opacity)
- Edit mode active background: `${categoryColor}1A`

The 20-color `PALETTE` array in `lib/utils.ts` is used by the category color picker in Settings. The picker enforces uniqueness — already-used colors are shown at 30% opacity and are non-interactive.

### Chart Conventions

All Recharts configuration is centralized in `src/lib/chartTheme.ts`. **Never inline Recharts props** — import from `chartTheme.ts`. This is necessary because Recharts does not support CSS custom properties, so hex values are encoded in named constants rather than scattered across components.

| Export | Apply to |
|---|---|
| `CHART_TOOLTIP_STYLE` | `<Tooltip contentStyle={CHART_TOOLTIP_STYLE}>` |
| `{...CHART_AXIS_PROPS}` | Spread onto every `<XAxis>` and `<YAxis>` |
| `CHART_CURSOR_BAR` | `<Tooltip cursor={CHART_CURSOR_BAR}>` on BarCharts |
| `CHART_CURSOR_LINE` | `<Tooltip cursor={CHART_CURSOR_LINE}>` on LineCharts |
| `CHART_LEGEND_STYLE` | `<Legend wrapperStyle={CHART_LEGEND_STYLE}>` |

### Card Component System

Three tiers — use the highest applicable tier, not the lower primitives directly.

**Tier 1 — Base `Card` (from `src/components/ui/card.tsx`):**
`border-border` is baked into the base class. Never add `border-border` or `bg-card` explicitly to a `<Card>` — they are redundant. Padding defaults: `CardHeader` `p-4`, `CardContent` `p-4 pt-0`.

**Tier 2 — Wrapper components (from `src/components/ui/cards.tsx`):**

| Component | Use for | Key difference |
|---|---|---|
| `PageCard` | Content, tables, lists, SVG-based visuals | `CardContent` retains `p-4` padding |
| `ChartCard` | Recharts chart components | `CardContent className="p-0"` — charts render edge-to-edge |
| `StatCard` | Compact numeric KPI display | Props: `label`, `value`, `variant` (`'expense'`/`'income'`/`'neutral'`) |
| `HeroCard` | Large prominent stat with gradient wash | Used for savings overview, health score hero |
| `HighlightCard` | Secondary accent stats in pairs | Paired with HeroCard |

All accept `title`, `children`, and optional `action` (rendered right-aligned in the header). `className` is forwarded to the Card root for one-off overrides.

**Tier 3 — Bespoke (use raw `Card`):**
- Alert card in Analytics — `border-warning/30` semantics, intentionally not abstracted
- Login card — unique layout, not a repeating pattern

### CSS Utility Classes

Utility classes defined in `src/web/frontend/src/index.css` under `@layer components`:

- **`.input-field`** — use on native `<input>` elements: `px-3 py-1.5 text-sm bg-background border border-border rounded-md text-foreground`. Replaces the repeated inline string.
- **`.btn-action`** — use for primary save/submit `<button>` elements outside the Button CVA system: `px-4 py-1.5 text-sm bg-foreground text-background rounded-md hover:opacity-90`.
- **`.btn-gradient`** — gradient background for the `default` Button variant. Do not apply manually; the CVA default variant uses it.
- **`.select-field`** — use on all native `<select>` elements. Includes the white SVG chevron via `background-image`. Never use `.input-field` on a `<select>`.
- **`.grid-scroll-panel`** — use on grid-area children that may contain long content: `overflow-y: auto; min-height: 0`. The `min-height: 0` is critical and must not be removed.
- **`.toggle-on`** — gradient active state for toggle switches. Applied by the toggle component; do not apply manually.
- **`.area-header`**, **`.area-title`**, **`.area-left`**, **`.area-right`**, **`.area-top`** — `grid-area` assignments for named CSS Grid template areas. No-ops outside a grid parent (safe on mobile).
- **`.page-grid-overview`**, **`.page-grid-analytics`**, **`.page-grid-finance`**, **`.page-grid-settings`** — per-page grid template definitions with responsive `@media` overrides. Mobile: single-column stack. Desktop (`md+`): multi-column viewport-filling grid.
- **Radix `<SelectTrigger>` chevron** — always `opacity-50` (`<ChevronDown className="h-4 w-4 opacity-50" />`). Do not change to `text-foreground` or any explicit color. The 50% opacity is intentional and must be preserved across all usages.

### Navigation Pattern

Sidebar (`hidden md:flex`, `w-56` md / `w-64` lg, `sticky top-0 h-screen`, `bg-card border-r border-border`) + bottom tabs (`md:hidden fixed bottom-0 h-16`, `bg-card border-t border-border`). Main content always has `pb-20 md:pb-0` for bottom-tab clearance.

Nav item states: active `bg-foreground/10 text-foreground font-medium`, inactive `text-muted hover:text-foreground hover:bg-foreground/5`. Six routes: Overview `/`, Transactions `/transactions`, Analytics `/analytics`, Finance `/finance`, Merchants `/merchants`, Settings `/settings`.

### Dashboard Layout Principles

Four rules that govern how all dashboard pages are structured. Introduced to eliminate page-level scrolling on desktop and keep interactive controls always visible.

#### 1. Viewport-Native Grid Layout

On `md+` screens, dashboard pages fill the viewport with CSS Grid — no page-level scrollbar. Each page defines its own `grid-template-areas`. On mobile, pages revert to single-column stacking with normal browser scroll.

**CSS implementation:**
- Page container: `p-4 space-y-4 md:h-full md:overflow-hidden md:grid md:gap-4 md:p-6 md:space-y-0 page-grid-<name>`
- Content panels: `area-<name> grid-scroll-panel space-y-4` (for panels with multiple cards)
- The `.grid-scroll-panel` utility (`overflow-y: auto; min-height: 0`) is required on every grid-area child that may contain long content. `min-height: 0` is critical — it prevents grid children from overflowing their row constraint.
- On mobile, `area-*` classes are no-ops (no grid parent), children stack via `space-y-4` on the outer container.

**Per-page grid areas (defined in `index.css`):**

| Page | CSS class | Areas | Columns (md+) | Rows (md+) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Overview | `.page-grid-overview` | `"header header" / "left right"` | `1fr 1.2fr` | `auto 1fr` |
| Analytics | `.page-grid-analytics` | `"header header" / "left right"` | `1fr 1fr` | `auto 1fr` |
| Finance | `.page-grid-finance` | `"top top" / "left right"` | `1fr 1fr` | `auto 1fr` |
| Settings | `.page-grid-settings` | `"title title" / "left right"` | `1fr 1fr` | `auto 1fr` |

**Panel assignments:**
- **Overview** — Left: stats + health score + budget/goals summaries + charts. Right: transactions (paginated, 20/page).
- **Analytics** — Left: health score breakdown + alerts. Right: comparison chart + velocity + top merchants + income/expense bar.
- **Finance** — Top strip: savings overview. Left: budgets. Right: goals. Trips integrated below.
- **Settings** — Left: categories + merchant overrides. Right: feature toggles + alert thresholds.
- **Merchants** — Full-width two-panel list/detail view (no grid template, uses flex layout).
- **Transactions** — Full-width two-panel list/detail view.

#### 2. Persistent Chrome Rule

Interactive controls that modify content (edit, delete, save, cancel) must always be visible when the content they control is on screen. **Never place action buttons in a footer that can scroll off-screen.**

**Correct pattern for `flex flex-col h-full` panel components:**
```
[Header: identity info + close button]              ← shrink-0, outside scroll
[Action bar: edit/delete  OR  cancel/save]          ← shrink-0, outside scroll
[Scrollable body: detail fields / content]          ← flex-1 overflow-y-auto
```

Action bar classes: `shrink-0 border-b border-border` with inner `flex gap-2 px-4 py-2`

**Existing components that implement this pattern:** `TransactionDetail`, `MerchantProfile`.

#### 3. Two-Panel Interaction Pattern

Detail/profile panels follow a split-panel layout: list on left, detail on right. Already established in `TransactionsPage` and `MerchantsPage` — apply to any future list-detail view.

- Left panel: `flex-1 overflow-y-auto`
- Right panel: `w-full md:w-96 shrink-0 border-l border-border bg-card overflow-hidden`
- On mobile: right panel takes full screen (left panel `hidden md:block`)

#### 4. Paginated Summary Lists

Summary/overview pages show paginated lists (page size 20), not infinite scroll dumps. Infinite scroll is only for dedicated list pages (e.g. `TransactionsPage`).

Pagination controls go in the `PageCard` header `action` slot. Reset page to 1 whenever the date/period changes.

```tsx
const PAGE_SIZE = 20;
const [page, setPage] = useState(1);
useEffect(() => { setPage(1); }, [start, end]);
const totalPages = Math.ceil((items?.length ?? 0) / PAGE_SIZE);
const pageItems = (items ?? []).slice((page - 1) * PAGE_SIZE, page * PAGE_SIZE);
```

Pagination control (only rendered when `totalPages > 1`):
```tsx
<div className="flex items-center gap-1">
  <Button variant="ghost" size="icon" className="h-6 w-6"
    onClick={() => setPage(p => Math.max(1, p - 1))} disabled={page === 1}>
    <ChevronLeft className="h-3 w-3" />
  </Button>
  <span className="text-xs text-muted">{page}/{totalPages}</span>
  <Button variant="ghost" size="icon" className="h-6 w-6"
    onClick={() => setPage(p => Math.min(totalPages, p + 1))} disabled={page === totalPages}>
    <ChevronRight className="h-3 w-3" />
  </Button>
</div>
```

### Common UI Patterns

- **Quick-select chips:** `px-2.5 py-1 text-xs rounded-full border transition-colors`. Active: `border-foreground text-foreground bg-foreground/10`. Inactive: `border-border text-muted hover:text-foreground`. "All time" chip is never highlighted active.
- **Segmented / inline toggle:** Container `flex rounded-md border border-border overflow-hidden`. Active button: `bg-primary text-primary-foreground`. Inactive: `text-muted hover:text-foreground`. Subsequent buttons add `border-l border-border`.
- **Source labels:** Use `SOURCE_DISPLAY_LABELS` from `@/components/icons/sources` for human-readable source display names (e.g. `'DBS PayLah!'`, used in `TransactionDetail.tsx`). `SOURCE_LABELS` contains single-character glyphs for the `SourceGlyph` component and must not be used for readable text. Never hardcode source strings in UI text.
- **Error feedback:** Always `text-sm text-destructive`, inline below the relevant field or immediately below the submit button.
- **Loading state:** Replace button label text (e.g. "Saving…"). Never leave the button without visual feedback during async operations.

### Icons & Typography

All icons from **lucide-react**. Three sizes: `w-3.5 h-3.5` inline actions (Pencil, Trash2), `w-4 h-4` standard buttons and form icons, `w-5 h-5` navigation. Category avatars use the emoji from the `icon` DB column, rendered inside a colored `div` (not an `<img>`).

**Edit/delete icon buttons — use this pattern everywhere, no exceptions:**
```tsx
<Button variant="ghost" size="icon" className={sizeClass} onClick={onEdit}>
  <Pencil className="w-3.5 h-3.5" />
</Button>
<Button variant="ghost" size="icon" className={`${sizeClass} text-destructive`} onClick={onDelete}>
  <Trash2 className="w-3.5 h-3.5" />
</Button>
```
- Always use `Button` from `@/components/ui/button` — never a bare `<button>` for icon actions
- Always `variant="ghost" size="icon"` — button size class (e.g. `h-7 w-7`) should match the surrounding context, not be universally fixed
- Edit button: no extra color class (inherits default muted ghost style)
- Delete button: always `text-destructive` — **never `text-muted`**, **never hidden on hover**
- Icons are always **persistent** — never `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100` or similar reveal patterns

Size scale: `text-xs` labels/metadata, `text-sm` body/button labels, `text-base` default inputs, `text-lg` card titles, `text-xl` page headings, `text-2xl` main figures and balance amounts. Weights: `font-medium` labels/nav items, `font-semibold` card titles/amounts, `font-bold` page h1s/balance figures.

Typography system uses `font-display` (heading variant) on card titles and `font-mono` for monetary amounts.

Responsive breakpoints: `sm` (640px) form layout changes, `md` (768px) sidebar visible / bottom tabs hidden / padding increases, `lg` (1024px) wider sidebar / two-column analytics grid.

## Database Schema

```sql
-- Per-user DB: /data/users/<username>/expense_tracker.db
transactions (id, source, source_id UNIQUE, amount, currency, exchange_rate, type, merchant, description, category, transaction_date, ingested_at, raw_data)

```

**app_settings keys:** `anomaly_multiplier`, `velocity_alert_threshold`, `budgets_enabled`, `goals_enabled`, `trips_enabled`, `subscriptions_enabled`, `llm_insight_content`, `llm_insight_generated_at`, `llm_weekly_insight_content`, `llm_weekly_insight_generated_at`, `llm_monthly_insight_content`, `llm_monthly_insight_generated_at`.

## Testing

Run: `pytest tests/ -v`

All tests use in-memory SQLite (`:memory:`) — no files on disk.
591 tests across all modules.
Fixtures in `tests/conftest.py` provide pre-initialized DB connections and sample configs.

Test files: `test_storage.py`, `test_categorizer.py`, `test_parsers.py`, `test_telegram_bot.py`, `test_web_api.py`, `test_web_auth.py`, `test_web_security.py`, `test_webhook.py`, `test_gmail_poller.py`, `test_exchange.py`, `test_recurring.py`, `test_ingestion.py`, `test_analytics.py`, `test_merchants.py`, `test_budgets.py`, `test_goals.py`, `test_trips.py`, `test_health_score.py`, `test_subscriptions.py`, `test_llm_service.py`, `test_user_manager.py`, `test_admin_app.py`, `test_admin_storage.py`, `test_config.py`.

## Security

- `config.yaml` is gitignored — contains bot tokens, password hashes, Gmail credentials
- `credentials.json`, `token.json`, `.env` are all gitignored
- Never commit any file containing real tokens, passwords, or API keys
- Use `config.example.yaml` as the template — it has placeholder values only
- On Oracle Cloud, `config.yaml` and `credentials.json` are mounted as read-only volumes in docker-compose
- Web sessions expire after 30 days of inactivity (sliding window, enforced in `AdminStorage.verify_session`)
- Admin panel has IP-based login lockout: 5 failed attempts → 15-minute lockout
- New users created via admin panel have `force_password_change=1` — they are redirected to `SetPasswordPage` on first login
- Telegram linking uses time-limited tokens (`telegram_link_tokens` table) rather than direct chat ID entry

## Branching

- `feature/*` branches merge into `develop` for integration testing
- `develop` merges into `main` only for releases (with version tag + CHANGELOG)
- See README.md for detailed workflow
- NEVER commit directly to `develop` or `master`, always spawn feature or hotfix/bugfix branch before committing
- **Merge commits required:** When merging a feature branch into `develop`, always use `git merge --no-ff <branch>` to create an explicit merge commit. This preserves a clear history of when each feature was integrated. Never use fast-forward merges.

## Commit Style

- No co-author lines in commits
- Use conventional commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `chore:`
- Keep messages concise — describe what and why, not how

## Common Modifications

- **Adding a new bank parser:** Create `src/parsers/<bank>.py` extending `BankParser`, add sender filter to `config.yaml`, add test in `tests/test_parsers.py`
- **Adding a Telegram command:** Add handler in `src/telegram_bot.py`, register in `setup_handlers()`, follow existing command pattern
- **Changing the schema:** Append a version in `src/migrations.py`; tests use production `init_db` and those same migrations.
- **Adding an API endpoint:** Add route in `src/web/app.py` inside `create_dashboard_app()`, add `Depends(require_auth)`. Finance feature routes also need `Depends(_get_storage)`.
- **Adding a category color:** Add the color to `getCategoryColor()` defaults and the 20-color `PALETTE` array in `src/web/frontend/src/lib/utils.ts`
- **Adding a new chart component:** Create in `src/components/charts/`. Import all Recharts config from `src/lib/chartTheme.ts`. Wrap in `ChartCard` from `src/components/ui/cards.tsx` if the component owns its card.
- **Adding a new page section:** Use `PageCard` (content/tables/lists) or `ChartCard` (Recharts charts) from `src/components/ui/cards.tsx`. Avoid bare `Card/CardHeader/CardContent` for standard layouts.
- **Adding a new full-page view:** Use `p-4 space-y-4 md:h-full md:overflow-hidden md:grid md:gap-4 md:p-6 md:space-y-0` on the outer container. Define a `.page-grid-<name>` template in `index.css` with mobile single-column and `md` two-column variants. Apply `.grid-scroll-panel` to every grid-area child. Panel components inside the grid must follow the Persistent Chrome Rule (header + action bar outside scroll area).
- **Deploying to Oracle Cloud:** `git pull` on the OCI instance, then `docker-compose down && docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up -d`. The `data/` volume persists across rebuilds. Cloudflare Tunnel reconnects automatically.
